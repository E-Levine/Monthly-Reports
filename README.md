# Monthly-Reports
R code for compiling monthly reports from Excel data files into Word doucument outputs on the Molluscs network using RMarkdown. 

Code will need to be downloaded to the correct R Project folder assocaited with the desired oyster project to ensure file mappings are accurate. Currently code exists for CERP and PBC reports.

Monthly reports consist of reporting obervations of mean salinity, recruitment, and dermo for the current and most recent months. PBC reports also include reporting of mean sedimentation rate and percent organic content for stations north and south of the C-51 output. When applicable, mean live and dead counts from oyster surveys are included.
